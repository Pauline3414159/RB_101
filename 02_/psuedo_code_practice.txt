 1)   a method that returns the sum of two integers
2)    a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
3)    a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

1_informal

input 2 integers
sum them
return the result

1_formal

START the program
SET the first number. SET the second number.
ADD the first number to the second number
RETURN the result
END

2_informal
input an array of strings
make a new, empty string
append every element into that new string
return the string

2_formal
START the method
SET the array of strings
SET an empty string
READ out every element of the array. As each element is ready out, append it to the new string
RETURN the string
END

3_informal a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
get the first array. get a second, empty array
read out the first array. if the index is odd, then save the value into the new array

3_formal
SET the first array of integers
SET the second empty array
READ out the first array. IF the index is odd, then SET the value into the second arry.
END
